# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Business Case
This project aims to provide suggestions to the Bank Marketing team to increase the number of customers subscribing to the bank's term deposit services. The dataset used contains information about 41,188 customers across 21 different categories of the Portuguese Bank, collected from the bank's customer records. The dataset covers direct phone call marketing campaigns conducted by the bank from May 2008 to November 2010.

## Data Information
The dataset includes various attributes such as age, job, marital status, education, housing loan status, and more for each customer. The most crucial column is 'y', which indicates whether a customer has subscribed to the bank's term deposit service (yes) or not (no).

## Problem Statement
The primary issue is the low subscription rate, with only approximately 1 in every 8 customers actually subscribing to the bank's services. The project's objective is to analyze the bank's marketing strategies and propose effective methods to increase customer subscription rates.

## Approach
1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand customer demographics, preferences, and trends.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones to extract meaningful insights.
3. **Model Building**: Develop predictive models to identify factors influencing customer subscription decisions.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance and identify key features driving subscription.
5. **Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations to the Bank Marketing team based on insights gained.

## Conclusion
By leveraging data-driven insights, the Bank Marketing team can tailor their strategies to target customers more effectively, thereby increasing subscription rates and maximizing profits while ensuring customer satisfaction.
